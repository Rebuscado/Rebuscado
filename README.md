Hey folks! 👋 I'm Lucas Ricardi, a student of Electrical Engineering cruising through the academic maze. By day, I'm knee-deep in circuits and equations, advancing through the engineering world. By night, I don the Full Stack Jr developer hat at Brodevo, tinkering with AngularJS, "Angular 2", and .NET to bring cool projects to life.

🕵️‍♂️ Like Sherlock Holmes, I love solving puzzles, be it untangling code knots or piecing together clues in a mystery novel. There's something about the thrill of discovery that keeps me going.

🎸 When I'm not crunching code or wrestling with circuits, you'll catch me strumming my guitar, jamming to tunes that add rhythm to my life.

Let's connect and dive into the world where engineering meets creativity! 🚀
